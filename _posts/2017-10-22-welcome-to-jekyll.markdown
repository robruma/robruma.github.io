Goodbye WordPress, Hello Jekyll.

I'm almost 100% migrated from AWS, although I'm still using SES, with a little help from CloudFlare and GitHub Pages and I'm getting a significant performance boost for free.

There are still a few problem that I'll work out in the next few days but so far so good... More later.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
